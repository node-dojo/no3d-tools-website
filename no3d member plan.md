Now that purchasing individual products is working on the site, I'd like to create "no3d membership" that is a polar product with a recurring subscription. 

The benefits attached are:
- download file of a zip file that (that we programmatically maintain) that has an up-to-date copy of all the workfiles from each no3d-tools-library stored in it. 
- every product on the website is free to them ("buy now" buttons replaced with "download" buttons)
- planned: gated access to particular parts of the website
- discord membership.

1. create a no3d membership product with a recurring subscription plan that costs $22.22 a month

2. Make
