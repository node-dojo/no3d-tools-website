# DOJO CALIPERS

## DESCRIPTION

This is a very sensible and reasonable solution for getting accurate measurements of meshes within the Blender work environment.

This is a fully functional 3D simulation of a digital caliper that measures with +/- .001 mm accuracy.

If any machinist, engineer, or rocket scientist ever questions you using a free Animation or Video Game Asset development software for serious CAD modeling tasks, just send them a screen recodring of you using this baby to measure your mesh models. That'll shut them up.

Just don't forget the battery.

## FEATURES

- Real working battery!
- Totally deserves to exist
- Possible meta commentary on the subjective reality of digital dimensions and our relationship to them!
- Don't think about it too much!

## HOW TO USE

1\. Just drag and drop the NO3D Caliper asset from the asset library into your 3D scene.

2\. Insert the battery in the modifier panel by increasing the value from 0 to 1.

3\. Note that the origin of this object is the very tip of the calipers jaws and is the 0 point of the measurement.  Place that point at point A of the desired measurement span.

4\. Measure by using the arrow gizmo to extend the upper jaw to point B of the desired measurement span.

5\. (Optional) Use your digital pen to write down on your digital note pad the captured measurement.

6\. (Mandatory) Proceed with your efficient an productive workday.
