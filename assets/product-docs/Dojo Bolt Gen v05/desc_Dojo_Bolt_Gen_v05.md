# Dojo Bolt Gen v05

## Description

Dojo Bolt Gen v05 is a highly configurable procedural bolt (fastener) generator for Blender, empowering makers and 3D designers to quickly create accurate, customizable bolts for a wide range of applications. Built with full geometry node support, this asset allows you to rapidly adjust thread types, bolt head shapes, shaft length/diameter, tip chamfering, and more—all nondestructively. Whether for product visualization, engineering illustration, or kitbashing, Bolt Gen eliminates the need to search for or remodel standard fasteners.


## Features

- **Fully Parametric** – All major bolt properties (diameter, length, thread pitch, head type, drive type, etc.) are adjustable via user-friendly geometry node controls.
- **Metric & Imperial Support** – Easily switch between standard sizes, or specify custom dimensions for unique bolts.
- **Thread Type Selection** – Choose from several common thread profiles (coarse, fine, custom), with real-time mesh updates.
- **Head & Drive Options** – Select flat, hex, pan, or socket heads; customize drive type for photoreal accuracy (Phillips, Allen, Slot, etc.).
- **Realistic Modeling** – Generates correct thread helix geometry, chamfered tips, and head fillets for render-ready detail.
- **Physically Accurate** – Outputs dimensionally correct fasteners compatible with other CAD and real-world models.
- **Asset Library Ready** – Save presets or drag-and-drop into any Blender scene.

## Usage
![alt text](<Dojo Bolt Gen v05 card assets/bolt gen mod panel.png>)
1. **Append or Link Asset:**  
   Open your Blender project and append or link the "Dojo Bolt Gen v05" geometry node group, or add it from the Asset Browser if installed.
2. **Add to Scene:**  
   Place the generator on a mesh, or use the included sample object. The bolt will appear in your scene.
3. **Adjust Parameters:**  
   - Select the bolt object or its geometry node modifier.
   - Use the modifier tab to edit parameters such as head type, drive style, diameter, length, and threads.
   - For custom values, simply type in the desired dimensions.
4. **Finalize:**  
   - If you require a mesh for export or further modeling, use "Apply Modifiers" (Ctrl+A) on the object.
   - Materials and UV maps are generated automatically for fast rendering.
5. **Kitbashing / Variations:**  
   - Duplicate the node group for rapid creation of many bolt types (e.g., socket cap, hex, set screw).

## Notes

- **Blender Version:** Requires Blender 3.5+ for full geometry node compatibility.
- **Performance:** Highly complex threads and fillets may slow down live editing; decrease thread mesh subdivisions for faster modeling.
- **Customization:** User may extend the geometry node group for additional fastener types (e.g., nuts, washers).
- **License:** CC0 / Public Domain – use in any project, commercial or personal.
