# Dojo Bolt Gen v05

## Description

Dojo Bolt Gen v05 is a flexible, procedural bolt generator for Blender designed to help makers and 3D artists create precise, customizable fasteners in minutes—optimized for 3D printing as well as digital projects. With robust geometry nodes, this asset allows you to fine-tune every aspect—thread profiles, head styles, shaft dimensions, chamfers, and more—non-destructively, ensuring clean geometry suitable for physical fabrication. Whether you're prepping bolts for engineering prototypes, product renders, or kitbashing sets, Bolt Gen streamlines your workflow, making it easy to go from concept to printable, real-world parts or detailed 3D scenes without ever remodeling from scratch.


## Features

- **Fully Parametric** – All major bolt properties (diameter, length, thread pitch, head type, drive type, etc.) are adjustable via user-friendly geometry node controls.
- **Head & Drive Options for 3D Printing** – Choose from multiple unique bolt head types (flat, hex, pan, socket) and drive styles (Phillips, Allen, Slot, etc.), each specifically designed for optimal results with 3D printing processes.

- **Asset Library Ready** – Save presets or drag-and-drop into any Blender scene.

## Usage
![alt text](<Dojo Bolt Gen v05 card assets/bolt gen mod panel.png>)
1. **Append or Link Asset:**  
   Open your Blender project and append or link the "Dojo Bolt Gen v05" geometry node group, or add it from the Asset Browser if installed.
2. **Add to Scene:**  
   Place the generator on a mesh, or use the included sample object. The bolt will appear in your scene.
3. **Adjust Parameters:**  
   - Select the bolt object or its geometry node modifier.
   - Use the modifier tab to edit parameters such as head type, drive style, diameter, length, and threads.
   - For custom values, simply type in the desired dimensions.
4. **Finalize:**  
   - If you require a mesh for export or further modeling, use "Apply Modifiers" (Ctrl+A) on the object.
   - Materials and UV maps are generated automatically for fast rendering.
5. **Kitbashing / Variations:**  
   - Duplicate the node group for rapid creation of many bolt types (e.g., socket cap, hex, set screw).

## Notes

- **Blender Version:** Requires Blender 4.5+ for full geometry node compatibility.
- **Performance:** Highly complex threads and fillets may slow down live editing; decrease thread mesh subdivisions for faster modeling.
- **Customization:** User may extend the geometry node group for additional fastener types (e.g., nuts, washers).
- **License:** CC0 / Public Domain – use in any project, commercial or personal.
